# Mission-to-Mars

## 1. Project Overview

Here, I used Flask and MongoDB in Python and Jupyter Notebooks to create a webpage displaying information about the planet Mars.
Specifically, I used Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape Mars-related news blurbs, summary data, and images from multiple 
online sources, and stored them in a Mongo database to present in a single Flask web app. The app can be refreshed by the user
to display new news items and featured images.
